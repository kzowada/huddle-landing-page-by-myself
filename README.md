## My process
My process was at first to think out my HTML. Then i start to draw out a layout on a white board with the HTML tags that I want to use and from there on get to coding. I coded the HTML first and then started styling it with CSS. I started out with the desktop but I think that this is the wrong approach. I think it is better to start out with the mobile design of the page and from there on expand to bigger screen sizes. Even my desktop view is not really responsive because when downsizing my browser window you can see that the SVG gets partially cut out. Im having trouble to actually make it responive. Also the content of my footer doesnt resize properly when downsizing. It would be nice if somebody can show me a good way on how to handle this properly. But i still learned a ton of stuff and got more comfortable with building my own layout of a webpage. And Im happy I managed to match the design from FrontEnd Mentor at full browswer size.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I'll have to focus on making my pages way more responsive. And start out with the mobile design first. Other then this I want to learn how to position content within containers better beacause it took me a long time to get the attribution-class at the center of my footer while the social media icons stay on the right side of the page.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38948102/center-one-and-right-left-align-other-flexbox-element) - This helped me with position an Element inside a a container that uses flexbox. I dont know if the answer there are common practice but it helped me out a lot.
